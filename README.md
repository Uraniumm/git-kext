# git-kext
## How to use:
* Download the .sh or .command script and launch it in terminal, all that's needed for usage instructions.

## Features:
* git-pull from the hard-coded repos included in the script.
* Automatically place and replace MacKernelSDK with kexts for compiling.
* Automatically compile and place the latest debug-Lilu kext in source folders.
* Quickly clean directory, remove MacKernelSDK or everything at once for a clean reset.
* Errors I haven't noticed yet and probably wont fix since I'll be the only one using this (kudos to you if you found this repo).
* Fancy "UI" that I'll look back on later and think it's a cluttered mess.
* Adderall crumbs left over in there somewhere.

## Requirements:
* Xcode (for Lilu building).
* An internet connection.
* Self-loathing tendencies to want to use this at all.
